title: Project Proposal: Streamline

### Problem

New York City is bustling with community organizing across its five boroughs. Events for nationally-recognized events such as the 2017 Women’s March garnered 3.3 - 4.6 million people. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case for many smaller grassroots organizations that address unique problems relevant to local and regional communities. Number of people at public demonstrations equates to power, and Streamline hopes to promote exploration and learning for its users by connecting them with these organizations and, in doing so, bring the necessary numbers to grassroots organizations to achieve change.


### Mission

The goal of Streamline is to address people’s loss of community and engagement by streamlining organizations and events nearby based on their proximity to users. This is a learning process that encourages users to explore their community through event options nearby and provides them with information on these organizations that may pique their interests.

In many urban areas, direct communication and a sense of belonging with the community is lost. Platforms like Nextdoor, whose mission is “The private social network for your neighborhood”, are indicative of people’s feelings of detachment from their community. Meanwhile, grassroots organizations struggle in numbers as canvassing is time-consuming and provides indefinite results since they frequently have niche goals. Streamline assists in community engagement by serving as a platform for these organizations to publicly share events they’re hosting, connecting them with users that may want to learn more.


### Similar Works

Our biggest competitor in the space of event-sharing and organization-finding would be Facebook which has 2.41 billion monthly active users as of June 2019. The fault of Facebook, however, is that grassroot organizations with an already small audience will have difficulty branching out to more people and will therefore be trapped within a small network of people. By basing events in proximity as opposed to their relevance to people’s social media newsfeed, Streamline will better bring events to people’s attention and if the user is interested in learning about their mission and drive. This is where the learning and community-immersion happens. This can’t be replicated through many social media platforms whose algorithms distribute content based on user interests that actually inhibits exploration and learning new topics.
